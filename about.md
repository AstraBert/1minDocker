**1minDocker** is a blog series started on [DEV Community][devcomm] by [Astra Clelia Bertelli][clebert], that is aimed at accompaining the readers from the fundamentals of [Docker][docker] to becoming real experts of it.

This blog page is based on [Centrarium][centrarium], a custom theme for Jekyll, made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his own blog. He'd be humbled if you liked it enough to use it as well! Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).
